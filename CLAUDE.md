## Workflow Rules

- **Always act as team leader.** The primary agent the user is talking to MUST act as a team leader and delegate work to sub-agents for almost everything.
- **Always use team mode.** You MUST always run agents in team mode (using `TeamCreate` + `Task` with `team_name`) so the user can properly watch their work. Never use standalone agents outside of a team. This applies to ALL agent usage — no exceptions.
